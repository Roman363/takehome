## Snapcraft Project - Technical Exercise

This project is a snapcraft exercise that demonstrates how to build a snap package for Ubuntu Core.

This was tested using Ubuntu 20.04 but will probably build on newer versions of Ubuntu as well. 

It will also require snapcraft.

Run the following command to build the snap:
```
scripts/build.sh
```

### How to complete this

There are two known problems with this snap. Compile and install the snap and then look for problems that can be fixed.

* If you don't know how to solve the problem in code, just describe the issue with as much detail as you can in your write up.
* Write up the changes you made or problems you found as though you were responding to a customer who had reported a problem.
* Optionally fork the project and make changes in code. Include a link to your fork.
